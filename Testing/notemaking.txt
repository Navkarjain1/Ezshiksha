In the quiet hum of dawn, the city stirred with a gentle energy, like a sleeping giant awakening from its slumber. The streets, once deserted, now teemed with life as early risers embarked on their daily routines. A soft mist hung in the air, casting a dreamlike aura over the urban landscape. Birds chirped their morning melodies, adding a natural symphony to the rhythmic hum of traffic below. Amidst the hustle and bustle, there was a sense of serenity, as if the city itself was taking a collective breath before diving headfirst into the day ahead.
